Recreating John Whitney's 'Experiments in Motion Graphics', 1968.

John Whitney's "Experiments in Motion Graphics," 1968, was a relatively forward and modern masterpiece for the time.  The artwork can resemble a Microsoft Windows screensaver in the 90s.  Yet, the number of generative calculations that went behind creating this piece was what I wanted to re-create.  

Using Processing, I first recreated the similar aesthetic of the 4:3 aspect ratio and the dark gray/black backgrounds.  Assigning a number for the total lines, which in Whitney's art piece was 31, this number was referenced when creating the 'snake'-effect that follows the first line drawn.  Next, Whitney assigned specific points to generate sine and cosine functions to create various geometries, mimicking Whitney's way of animating as closely as possible.  Adjusting the movement speeds added a detail that he often used when transitioning from one animation to another.  

I faced some challenges when trying to separate the delay in each yellow and orange line separately.  Also, controlling how the geometry is drawn was the most challenging part of this recreation.  Finally, Whitney used multiple 'scenes,' where his monologue explained that he did not create his animation in real-time but stitched between various scenes.
